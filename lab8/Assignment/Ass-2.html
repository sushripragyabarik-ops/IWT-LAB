	It allows developers to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), ensuring better maintainability and flexibility. 
	CSS is essential for creating consistent, responsive, and visually engaging web pages.
	Cascading style sheets or CSS is an essential technology used in the development of a website and it contributes greatly to what we see at face value or first glance of the website. CSS (introduced in the late 1990s) has become a necessary element of designers and developers work. This helps them regulate how the web documents look, appear and their layout as well as ensure a uniform and attractive interface for the users irrespective of the device or browser used. The primary function of CSS is to allow separation of the layout (HTML) and formatting (CSS) on a webpage while working concurrently with HTML. Such a separation improves the sustainability, adaptability, and extendibility of web implementations.Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental to modern web design, providing the crucial layer of presentation, layout, and visual aesthetics to raw HTML content. By enabling the separation of content and design, CSS allows developers to maintain cleaner code, significantly reducing redundancy. It provides immense flexibility, allowing for responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices, improving accessibility and user experience. CSS enhances efficiency through centralized styling, where one file can control the layout of multiple pages, speeding up load times. Ultimately, CSS transforms plain,, functional web pages into engaging, modern, and branded user experiences.
